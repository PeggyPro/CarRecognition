# CarRecognition - AI Model 

This is one of the best vehicle recognition applications. It can determine the car's license plate number, color, model, brand, and year.

**Author: Jasurbek Shukurov**
## Features

- **License Plate Recognition**: Accurately detects and recognizes license plate numbers from images.
- **Vehicle Color Detection**: Identifies the primary color of the vehicle.
- **Model and Brand Identification**: Determines the specific model and brand of the vehicle.
- **Year Estimation**: Estimates the manufacturing year of the vehicle.

## Installation

Clone the repository:
```
   bash
   git clone https://github.com/jasur-2902/Car-Recognition.git
   cd Car-Recognition
```


##Usage
Upload an image of a vehicle.
The application will process the image and display the detected information, including license plate number, vehicle color, model, brand, and estimated year.

##How it Works
The CarRecognition app uses a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of vehicle images. It processes the input image, extracts relevant features, and then applies a series of classification algorithms to determine the car's details.
